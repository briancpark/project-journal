# School Projects
Here lies a journal of school coding projects and assignments I have completed at UC Berkeley. I cannot share the source code of the projects because of confidentiality and plagarism, so I will summarize my thoughts and findings here instead.

## Hog
My first CS project at UC Berkeley where I was exposed to functional programming and Python to a made up dice game of Hog.

## Maps
A project where I was exposed to the list comprehensions, data structures, and data abstractions. Create a Vonori

## Ants vs. Bees
This project exercised object oriented programming with a fun little web app game.

## Scheme Interpreter
Built a full interpreter in Python for Scheme. The program fully replicates the REPL environment of Scheme.

## Game of Life
Implemented John Conway's Game of Life in C through bit manipulations to produce bitmap images and movies.

## RISC-V Classify
Made an artificial neural network in RISC-V assembly. Matrix and vector operations were implemented such as ReLU, argmax, and matrix multiply.

Uses the Python unittest library.

## RISC-V CPU
Made a RISC-V CPU in Logisim. Testing was done through Python and Bash scripts.

## Numc
Made a numpy clone in C. Uses SIMD and MIMD (specifically Intel Intrinsics and OpenMP) to accelerate matrix operations such as add, subtract, absolute value, and negation. Also sped up DGEMM to a factor of 110X and matrix exponentation to a factor of 2200X. Optimizations with caches were also performed to achieve such a great speedup. This was tested on the Intel i7-4770 processor.

## Pacman AI
Implemented a series of AI functionality to Pacman such as searching algorithms, gametrees, Markov Decision Processes, reinforcement learning, Bayesian Networks, hidden Markov models, and particle filtering.

## Neural Networks
Created neural networks to estimate sin wave, classify digits, and classify different languages.
