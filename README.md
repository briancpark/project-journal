# School Projects
Here lies a journal of school coding projects and assignments I have completed at UC Berkeley. I cannot share the source code of the projects because of confidentiality and plagarism, so I will summarize my thoughts and findings here instead. If possible, I will also include a link to the project spec. Having a journal like this helps me keep track of the plethora of projects I've completed!

## Hog
My first CS project at UC Berkeley where I was exposed to functional programming and Python to a made up dice game of Hog. GUI was done in Tkinter. [Spec](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/proj/hog/)

## Yelp Maps
A project where I was exposed to the list comprehensions, data structures, and data abstractions. Created a Voronoi diagram of reccomendations overlaying on the map of the campus! It used simple machine learning algorithms such as centroid method and k-means clustering algorithm! [Spec](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/proj/maps/)

## Scheme Interpreter
Built a full interpreter in Python for Scheme. The program fully replicates the REPL environment of Scheme. This was a really cool project building a functional programming language and interpreter from scratch with an interpreted lanugage! [Spec](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp19/proj/scheme/)

## BearMaps
Created a mini web map application using OpenStreetMap of Berkeley. Application uses data structures and algorithms such as tries, hashing, A* shortest path, rasterizing, and KD-trees. [Spec](https://cs61bl.org/su20/projects/bearmaps/)

## RISC-V Classify
Made an artificial neural network in RISC-V assembly. Matrix and vector operations were implemented such as ReLU, argmax, and matrix multiply.

Uses the Python unittest library. [Spec](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj2/)

## Numc
Made a numpy clone in C. Uses SIMD and MIMD (specifically Intel Intrinsics and OpenMP) to accelerate matrix operations such as add, subtract, absolute value, and negation. Also sped up DGEMM to a factor of 110X and matrix exponentation to a factor of 2200X. Optimizations with caches were also performed to achieve such a great speedup. This was tested on the Intel i7-4770 processor. [Spec](https://cs61c.org/fa20/projects/proj4/)
